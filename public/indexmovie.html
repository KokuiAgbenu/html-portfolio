 <hr />
 <h3>Inception</h3>
 <p>One of the most mind fuck movies of all time<br />Also directed by one of the film making goat's Christopher Nolan</p>
 <h3>Cool Runnings</h3>
 <p>Such a feel good movie with all the elements you'd want. Underdog story, comedy, romance, and sporting victory</p>
 <h3>Avatar</h3>
 <p>Such a visually stunning movie and knowing the technology that goes into making it, makes it even more amazing. Directed by one of the goats, James Cameron</p>
